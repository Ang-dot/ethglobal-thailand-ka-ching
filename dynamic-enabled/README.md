## 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰
𝐊𝐚-𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 is reimagining the multisig wallet experience for Web3, blending seamless setup, security, and interactive fun community. With AI Agent-Powered Wallet Creation, users can launch a multisig wallet in seconds using just a single prompt—no technical expertise needed.

Our solution features Explainable AI (XAI) for transaction fraud detection, providing clear insights into why a transaction is flagged as risky, giving users both control and confidence in every decision. Enhanced with Web3-native 2FA and real-time notifications, Ka-Ching ensures every transaction is secure and fully in your hands.

And for a playful twist, users can settle who pays the gas fee through a Thai street-inspired game of Tuk-Tuk, Traffic Jam, and Food Cart—adding a bit of fun to transaction management.

Why settle for a boring wallet when Ka-Ching brings security, ease, and a dash of adventure to every transaction? Make every click count—and let Ka-Ching handle the rest!

## 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭
Managing multisig wallets and staying secure in the Web 3 space can be complex and overwhelming, especially for new users. Traditional multisig setups are often tedious, notifications lack immediacy, and fraud prevention mechanisms lack transparency and adaptability. Our goal is to lower entry barriers, improve security, and enhance user experience through AI and decentralized technologies.

## 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬

### 🔍 On-Chain Fraudulent Transactions Detection Powered by Explainable AI and Cartesi
Our AI-driven fraud detection system uses **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** to analyze transactions in real time. This gives users clear, actionable insights into why a transaction might be flagged, enabling smarter decision-making. **Cartesi Rollups** handle complex computations off-chain for scalable, transparent fraud detection while settling critical data on-chain.

### 🤖 AI Agent-Powered Wallet Creation with XMTP Integration
With a single prompt, users can set up a multisig wallet without the usual repetitive steps. This feature leverages AI agents and XMTP to streamline the setup process, making it accessible even for those with no technical experience. 

### 🔐 Gnosis Safe Multisig with Next-Level Customization
Built on the trusted **Gnosis Safe framework**, our wallet offers secure, multisignature control with enhanced AI monitoring. Users can tailor security settings to their preferences, ensuring transactions align with their needs, whether for individuals or DAOs.

### 🔔 Seamless 2FA Authentication and On-Chain Notifications
Integrated **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** powered by **WorldID** adds an extra layer of security with privacy-preserving, zero-knowledge proofs. Real-time alerts through **Push Protocol** ensure users are instantly notified of actions requiring approval, enhancing transaction control without interrupting workflow.

### 🎮 Bonus: The Thai Challenge: A New Take on Rock, Paper, Scissors
Adding a unique twist, Ka-Ching features a blockchain-powered game inspired by Thai street life—Tuk-Tuk, Traffic Jam, and Food Cart—where users can settle the age-old question of "Who’s covering the gas fee?" 

| **Element**   | **Defeats**    | **Reason**                                                    |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tuk-Tuk       | Traffic Jam    | Tuk-Tuk zips through the traffic.                              |
| Traffic Jam   | Food Cart      | Traffic Jam blocks the Food Cart.                              |
| Food Cart     | Tuk-Tuk        | The Food Cart feeds the hungry driver (because who can resist Thai street food?) |
